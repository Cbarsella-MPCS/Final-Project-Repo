    "# Final Project: Has Polling Accuracy Changed Due to Smart Phone Usage\n",
    "In the U.S., public opinion polling has been used as a tool to predict elections and understand the feelings of the american people. This data is critical in American society for political, economic, and social reasons. Polling allows politicians to calibrate their messaging in order to better serve their constituents, businesses and financial analysts use it to make assumptions on the state of the world in order to inform decisions, and voters throughout the country use it to inform how their communities are responding to political change. Since the proliferation of home telephones, polls have been conducted through calling phones and asking respondants their opinion on cectain topics. The introduction of the smart phone has increased the ability of users to screen unwanted phone calls potentially skewing who is answering polling calls. This leaves us with our H1 hypothesis that the introduction of the smart phone has decreased the reliability of polling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will attempt to validate or invalidate that hypothesis through measuring the spread between poll results and reality."

    "Poll Providers: As there are several different poll providers, many of which change political alignment overtime, we will keep our research to Gallop polls which are generally considered the gold standard for american opinion polling. Gallup also has the added advantage of having consistently conducted polls over the time frame of our research.\n",
