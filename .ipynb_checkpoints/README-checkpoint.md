# Final-Project-Repo
Repository for my final repo

Proposal:

I would like to analyze polling data over several election cycles to understand if polling has become less effective in determining outcomes of elections.
Return a list of polling election items, polling results, and election results 
Calculate an expected result based on the polling information
Compare expected result against actual results
Statistically measure how effective polls are over time
Determine if polling has become less effective at predicting election results overtime

Execution Plan:
Week 4: Determine scope of elections and polls
Week 5: Gain access to a database for polling results
Week 6: Implement a program to intake the necessary data
Week 7: Statistically analyze the data to determine polling effectiveness
Week 8: Pull results into a presentation
